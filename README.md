# Kitaplatz-Zentrale

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In big cities like Berlin it is a struggle to find a Kindergarten both for the parents who have to start applying for the Kindergarten even before the child is born and the kindergartens who are being flooded with calls and visits from parents even when they are already full. 
Furthermore many parents have some requirements towards the kindergarten starting with distance but also more specific things like bilingual, raising concepts etc. 
The Kindergarten also not just accepts any child that comes but rather picks children according to their age, gender etc. so that there is a good distribution of children present at all times.
This process is tedious and not optimal. We want to solve it by building a Kitaplatz-zentrale, an online platform that lets parents search for Kindergarten that match their requirements and apply there in the fastest way possible.
Kindergarten will then be able to accept the children they want in a convenient way.
